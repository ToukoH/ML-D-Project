# ML-D-Project

To run code locally, run the following in shell (local terminal or in vs code cntr + shift + p -> create new python terminal):

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then in vs code you can cntr + shift + p
-> select interpreter
-> venv (probably recommended by vs code)

Vs code will probably make you download the Jupyter extention so just press download or install or whatever it is.
Then you can run the notebooks.
